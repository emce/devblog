# MacOS must-have applications

It's been a year since my last post, so I'm getting back, but with lighter content - here's the list of my must-have applications for Mac OS X.

1. [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) _(free)_ This is my working environment, so without this I would have no work ;)
2. [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) _(free/paid)_ This is easy to use Android emulator alternative, very fast, with different features, allowing fully control Android device.
3. [AirMail](http://airmailapp.com/) _(paid)_ The best alternative IMO for Mail.app - very intuitive, simple, but powerful mail client.
4. [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) _(paid)_ Source code editor with support for many programming languages, with dedicated API and bunch of plugins.
5. [Reeder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-3/id880001334) _(paid)_ News/RSS reader with support for multiple services, especially Feedly.
6. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) _(free)_ Terminal emulator, with features like window transparency, full-screen mode, window-divided mode, etc.
7. [Wire](https://wire.com/) _(free)_ Before there was Telegram, now - it's time for Wire - simple, but secure communicator.
8. [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) _(free)_ Awesome tool to convert any video file to most common formats.
9. [Cocoa Rest Client](https://github.com/mmattozzi/cocoa-rest-client/releases) _(free)_ App for testing HTTP/REST endpoints - simple, but suitable.
10. [sqlitebrowser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) _(free)_ Name speaks for itself - simple, but still suitable.
11. [Affinity Photo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-photo/id824183456) _(paid)_ A powerful alternative for PhotoShop and free GIMP. [Try and see for yourself.
12. [Antetype](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/antetype/id820188491) _(paid)_ Prototyping app with wide range of modes and layouts.
13. [Radium](https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/radium-perfect-internet-radio/id597611879) _(paid)_ Beautiful and intuitive internet radio player.
