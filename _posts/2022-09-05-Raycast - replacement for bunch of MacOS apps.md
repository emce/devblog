# Raycast - replacement for bunch of MacOS apps

I'm using Raycast since I found it as small project on Github. But till recently, it was just replacement for Spotlight, with few additional functions. Lately, I put more attention to message I got from Raycast newsletter regarding plugins system. I decided to take a look. And it was a lucky shot.

Let me tell you more. As daily MacBook and MacOS user, i'm looking for tools/apps, which will make my life and work easier (probably like majority of You). I don't want to write a poem, so I just show the table, where there will be plugin from Raycast, which became a replacement for application from the same row.

Feel fre to try it - it will make your life easier, and for sure free your Mac resources. And productivity boost.

|Upcoming calendar events|Dato|
|App Uninstaller|AppCleaner|
|Window Management|Magnet|
|Cofee|Amphetamine|
|Format JSON|Jayson|
|Tailwind CSS Colorpicker|Tint|
|Todo List|Todoist|

Those are apps replacements, but Raycast has also a great amount of extensions for tools and apps used on daily basis, I can just list few:

- 1Password
- Brew
- Apple Notes
- Spotify
- Notion
- Youtube
- Google Chrome
- Github
- Things
- Zoom
- JIRA/Confluence
- Docker
- Slack
- Google Workspace
and many, many more...

Feel free to try it:
