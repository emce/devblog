If you're using **Home Assistant** to automate your smart home, adding real-time **WhatsApp notifications** can greatly improve how you receive alerts and important updates. **WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API)** allows seamless integration, enabling Home Assistant to send messages via WhatsApp for automations, security alerts, and system notifications.

In this blog post, Iâ€™ll explore Home Assistant integration with WAHA to get WhatsApp messages whenever a specific trigger occurs.

## What is WAHA?

**WAHA - WhatsApp HTTP API** is an open-source solution that allows communication with WhatsApp through an API. Unlike cloud-based services, WAHA runs **locally** and allows direct integration with various systems, including **Home Assistant**.

### Benefits of Using WAHA with Home Assistant:
- ðŸ”¹ **Instant notifications** via WhatsApp.
- ðŸ”¹ **Local hosting** â€“ you have full control over your messages.
- ðŸ”¹ **Multiple numbers** â€“ manage notifications across different accounts.
- ðŸ”¹ **Works with Home Assistant automations** to send alerts dynamically.
- 
But it's just a small part of appliances of WAHA... But that's a topic for another blog post.

## Setting Up WAHA with Home Assistant

### **Step 1: Install WAHA**
To use WAHA with Home Assistant, you first need to set it up. WAHA can be installed using **Docker**, ensuring easy deployment.

1. Run WAHA with the following **Docker command**:
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name waha -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data/tokens ghcr.io/tulir/whatsmeow-http-api
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` (or your server IP).
3. Scan the QR code using your **WhatsApp** account.

At this stage, your WAHA instance is ready to send and receive messages.

### **Step 2: Configure Home Assistant to Use WAHA**
Once WAHA is running, we need to configure Home Assistant to send messages through it.

1. Open your `configuration.yaml` file in Home Assistant and add the following **RESTful notification** configuration:
   ```yaml
   notify:
     - name: whatsapp_waha
       platform: rest
       resource: "http://<WAHA_SERVER_IP>:3000/sendMessage"
       method: POST
       data:
         jid: "<YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_WITH_COUNTRY_PREFIX>"
         message: "Home Assistant notification!"
   ```

   - Replace `<WAHA_SERVER_IP>` with the actual IP of your **WAHA server**.
   - Update `YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_WITH_COUNTRY_PREFIX` with the **phone number** (in international format) you want to send messages to (like 44324555555).

2. Restart Home Assistant to apply the configuration.

---

### **Step 3: Test WhatsApp Notifications**
To verify that the configuration works, trigger a test message in Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Developer Tools > Services**.
2. Select the `notify.whatsapp_waha` service.
3. Enter the following JSON in the **Service Data** field:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Hello! This is a test message from Home Assistant."
   }
   ```
4. Click **Call Service**.

Your phone should receive a WhatsApp message from WAHA!

## **Using WhatsApp Notifications in Home Assistant Automations**
Now that the integration is working, letâ€™s set up an **automation** to notify you via WhatsApp when an event occurs (e.g., motion detection, door opening, or temperature exceeding a threshold).

Example: Notify via WhatsApp when motion is detected:

```yaml
alias: "Motion Alert via WhatsApp"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor
    to: "on"
action:
  - service: notify.whatsapp_waha
    data:
      message: "ðŸš¨ Motion detected! Check your security cameras."
mode: single
```

This automation will **send a WhatsApp message** whenever motion is detected.

## **Expanding WAHA + Home Assistant Capabilities**
Once WhatsApp notifications are set up, you can extend their use with:
- **Smart Home Alerts**: Get WhatsApp alerts for security, temperature, or device statuses.
- **Reminders & Schedules**: Send daily or weekly reminders via WhatsApp.
- **Command Responses**: Develop automation to reply with real-time **sensor readings** or system status updates.

By integrating **WAHA** with **Home Assistant**, you can receive smart and instant notifications via **WhatsApp** for various smart home events. This self-hosted solution ensures **greater privacy** and reliability compared to cloud-based integrations.

**Try it out and enhance your smart home experience!**
